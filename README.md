# eupnea-apps

Distro + toolkit independent Apps GUI for EupneaOS and Depthboot.  
Written with the [kivy](https://kivy.org/) python gui framework.

## Disclaimer:

These apps are not designed/intended to be run on non depthboot systems. **DO NOT** just run it on
your system as it might override some settings and/or damage your OS!!! Run it in a virtual machine.

## How to run the apps for debugging/developing:

1. Install pip.
2. Install kivy with pip: `pip install kivy`
3. Clone the repo and run the apps main.py with python3.10 or later.
